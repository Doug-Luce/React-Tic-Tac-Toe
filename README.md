## Free Code Camp Tic Tac Toe Project.

This project was built for the Free Code Camp Tic Tac Toe project. If you look at the timeline and my commit messsages you'll see that this project proved to be difficult for me, but I'm happy with how it turned out in the end. The biggest trouble I ran into building this in React is that state being asynchronous you can't rely on it for game state. I decided to keep the game state outside of the state container, and use forceUpdate() when I needed to. 

Thanks for taking a look!
